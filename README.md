# Dead By Daylight Ranked

## Tech Stack

PostgreSQL, Express.js React.js and Node.js

## Description

A passion project for my favourite game Dead By Daylight by Behaviour Interactive. This game came out in 2016 and no competitive mode has been released. 

For the developers to create a competitive mode the game would need some major balancing to perks and add-ons to make it fair to new players. Regardless of the balancing issues, I wanted to create a 3rd part dead by daylight ranked to see how Players match up to eachother.
